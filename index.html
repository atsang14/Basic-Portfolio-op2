			Hello whom may concern,

				I'm Austin T. This is a webpage to showcase my basic skills in HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascade Style Sheets). 

				I'm currently a Computer Science Major at San Francisco State Univeristy. I'm not sure exactly what I'd like to go into as a career. Web Development is something that interests me. This webpage is not only a way for me to showcase my HTML & CSS capabilities, but to also show express my interests and my current accomplishments.
